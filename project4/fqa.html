        <h2>You have the question and we have got the answer. Here are a few of the Frequently Asked Questions!</h2>
        <h3>Why Hire an event planner?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To save yourself from the stress and headache of planning it.</li>
            <li>To give a new, refreshing boost to a repeat event.</li>
            <li>To seamlessly manage the often underestimated, challenging logistical nature of an event.</li>
            <li>Because you are not sure where to start.</li>
            <li>Because you started too late.</li>
            <li>Because planning this event is just 10% of your overall workload.</li>
            <li>Because you need to make the most out of your budget.</li>
            <li>Because this event is going to be in the spotlight. Or it needs to be.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What kind of events does your company Plan? Fabulous ones!!! Specifically:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-profit fundraisers</li>
            <li>Corporate celebrations</li>
            <li>Conferences</li>

            <li>Bar mitzvah</li>
            <li>You name it we can plan it!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What does it cost to work with your company?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We are a fee-based Company. Our fees are based upon an estimation of the hours that we will spend
                working on your event. This fee is agreed upon at the time of contract and only changes should the scope
                of the project change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do you Travel?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes, we do all the time. This will include travel outside of our home base of Maryland we have worked
                in, North Carolina , Florida, Washington, D.C., New York , The US Virgin Islands, Texas – just to name a
                few…</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>So, when it comes do you do it all? Basically! Just a few things we do not do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We cannot be hired for on-site management ONLY. If we were not part of the planning process, We Like to
                be there from start to finish, we might really mess things up.</li>
            <li>We are not a source if you are just looking to rent décor or tables and chairs. We are a planning
                company, not a rental company.</li>
            <li>For non-profit events and fundraisers, we don’t solicit sponsors. We can help design attractive sponsor
                packages and help you strategize the solicitation process, but we feel strongly that the benefiting
                organization, not a third party, should cultivate
                sponsor relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What size events do you manage?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are not many “typical” scenarios when it comes to our clients and events – and we love it that
                way! One day we have a fundraising event for a couple hundred attendees, and then the next week we have
                a company’s meeting with a couple of thousand associates. Yes we can even handle have an intimate event
                for under 100 guests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How can we contact you?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are interested in having us plan your next event, please contact: <a href= mailto:cherelegance2016@gmail.com>Cher-Elegance</a></li>
